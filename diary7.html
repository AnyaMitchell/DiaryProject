                <h3>BEST PART OF THE WEEK:</h3>
                <br>
                <p>I did enjoy continuing our work using Mongo.</p>
                <p>However, the highlight of the week has to be the to-do list assignment. despite encountering a minor hiccup at the start, the issue was quickly resolved and I was able to get stuck in. The task provided an opportunity to apply the concepts of what we'd learnt, push the boundaries of my understanding, and express my own creativity. I was happy with my completed work.</p>

                <h3>WORST PART OF THE WEEK:</h3>
                <br>
                <p>I honestly cannot think of a bad part of the week for coding. Therefore, enjoy this video, as my worst part of the week was finishing season 2 of 'The Bear'.</p>

                <h3>PROBLEM I SOLVED:</h3>
                <br>
                <p>We were tasked with solving several problems using JS Complete. I enjoyed this assignment as the hands-on experience was a clear indicator that I understood the work and gained confidence in my ability to apply it in future projects.</p>
