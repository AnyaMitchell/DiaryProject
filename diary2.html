                <p>A toss up between 2:</p>
                <p>Working on a presentation with Kev: I felt we collaborated really well and receiving the comment "above and beyond" was amazing.</p>
                <p>Working on my first project (this diary). I've had the opportunity to unleash my creativity, put my newfound expertise in flexbox and animations to the test, and fortify my proficiency in HTML and CSS.</p>

                <h3>WORST PART OF THE WEEK:</h3>
                <br>
                <p>To be honest it's been challenging to pinpoint something I didn't particularly enjoy this week, as overall it has been positive.</p>
                <p>If I were to select one aspect, it would be SQL, due to it being an entirely new territory for me and there was alot of information to absorb. Nevertheless Paul was great ensuring everyone grasped the concept before progressing. I look forward to learning more about SQL and eventually applying it in a project.</p>

                <h3>PROBLEM I SOLVED:</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Flexbox. I wouldn't consider myself an expert in flexbox, however I have certainly boosted my conifdence in using it. While I've dabbled with it in the past without much success, the opportunity to incorporate flexbox techniques in this project has provided me with the motivation to continue experimenting with it, gradually improving my skills.</p>
