                <p>Pokemon Escape Room</p>
                <p>It was a really fun project to work on and we were really proud of our finished project. I had a good team where it was easy to discuss things and keep each other up to date, but we also reached out and helped team members when one of us was stuggling with something. I would be happy to work with this team again.</p>

                <h3>WORST PART OF THE WEEK:</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Unfortunately, due to time constraints, we couldn't incorporate all our exciting ideas. We recognised the importance of simplicity for this project so focused on the essential details to ensure completion. While we were able to deliver a solid project, it was a shame we couldn't fully explore and try out all the ideas to further our project.</p>

                <h3>PROBLEM I SOLVED:</h3>
                <br>
                <p>For our project we decide to work seperately on different sections to get the bulk of code completed quickly. Then we came together as a team to join everything together. This in the end was quite longwinded when we had to choose which elements to delete and change. While we did solve all the issues, looking back it might have been easier to all work on each section as a team.</p>
