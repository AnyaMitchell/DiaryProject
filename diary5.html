                <p>SQL</p>
                <p>I really enjoyed learning SQL. Having the opportunity to explore it further and experiement by playing around during the assignments. I'd definitely be interested in delving deeper in SQL to expand my knowledge and proficiency, especially due to the vast potential it can offer.</p>

                <h3>WORST PART OF THE WEEK:</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Javascript Engine</p>
                <p>While it was intersting to learn about this, and I do feel I got my head around how it works, there was a lot to take in and I feel I would need a few more days to really get stuck into it until I feel completely confident in my understanding. Therefore I think my lack in knowledge of the subject as a whole if the only reason I'm putting it as the worst part of the week</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>A promise in JS has 3 states: pending, resolved, rejected</li>

                    <li>Heap stores data</li>

                <h3>PROBLEM I SOLVED:</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Getting my quiz game to work. I kept trying various code so that after answering a question it would tell you if you were correct or not, then move on to the next question. I could only do one or the other and it was quite frustrating. However after getting it to work with th efirst question it was jsut a matter of repeating the process with some tweaks for the rest of the quiz.</p>
