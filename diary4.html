                <p>Receiving feedback on my Normalisation assignment</p>
                <p>While I felt I had a solid grasp of the concept during class, I began doubting myself during the solo assignment. I made sure to voice my concerns when submitting my completed work, seeking the opportunity to clarify any uncertainties and potentially revise my work.</p>
                <p>Upon receiving my feedback, I was pleased to discover that my solution was logical and would work in real scenarios. I am now looking forward to the SQL project next week.</p> 
                <p>Note for future assignments: Include more annotations to demonstrate my thought processes, to show my understanding of the task is not just a coincidence.</p>

                <p>The Drum Kit Project</p>
                <p>I was really excited to get involved with this project. I thought it to be a unique and enjoyable addition to my portfolio that I wouldn't have considered otherwise. However, in retrospect, I feel I started the project with too many ideas, when in reality I should have begun with a modest approach of one small idea and gradually expanded. I found myself in a situation where constant code changing was causing disruption in the overall functionality. Should I persist in my editing until I achieve the desired result (or at least completed), or should I consider starting from scratch?</p>

                <h3>PROBLEM I SOLVED:</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Throughout the drum kit project, I encountered a series of problems that needed solving. Sometimes these issues seemed to stack up making it confusing and difficult to unravel. I did successfuly fix the critical problems ensuring the drum kit was functional by the deadline.</p>
