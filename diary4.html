                <p>Receiving feedback on my Normalisation assignment</p>
                <p>While I felt I had a solid grasp of the concept during class, I began doubting myself during the solo assignment. I made sure to voice my concerns when submitting my completed work, seeking the opportunity to clarify any uncertainties and potentially revise my work.</p>
                <p>Upon receiving my feedback, I was pleased to discover that my solution was logical and would work in real scenarios. I am now looking forward to the SQL project next week.</p> 
                <p>Note for future assignments: Include more annotations to demonstrate my thought processes, to show my understanding of the task is not just a coincidence.</p>

                <p>The Drum Kit Project</p>
                <p>I was really excited to get involved with this project. I thought it to be a unique and enjoyable addition to my portfolio that I wouldn't have considered otherwise. However, in retrospect, I feel I started the project with too many ideas, when in reality I should have begun with a modest approach of one small idea and gradually expanded. I find myself in a situation where constant code changing is causing disruption in the overall functionality. Should I persist in my editing until I achieve the desired result (or at least completed), or should I consider starting from scratch?</p>

                <!-- <p>Flexbox. I wouldn't consider myself an expert in flexbox, however I have certainly boosted my conifdence in using it. While I've dabbled with it in the past without much success, the opportunity to incorporate flexbox techniques in this project has provided me with the motivation to continue experimenting with it, gradually improving my skills.</p>
